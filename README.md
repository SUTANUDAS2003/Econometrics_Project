# Factors Affecting Gross National Income (GNI)

This repository contains the analysis and findings of a project titled **"Factors Affecting Gross National Income (GNI)"**. The goal of this project is to explore the intricate relationships between various economic factors and their influence on Gross National Income (GNI) across countries. 

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to evaluate whether key economic indicators, such as GDP, GNI per capita, inflation, and foreign exchange, among others, can explain the variations in Gross National Income (GNI) across countries.

## Methodology

We utilized the statistical software package **STATA** for data analysis. Using regression analysis, we assessed how the independent variables influence the dependent variable, GNI. The dataset includes a comprehensive set of variables that act as both direct and indirect indicators of economic performance.

### Analysis Overview

Regression analysis was conducted to determine the strength and significance of the relationships between the dependent and independent variables. The analysis explored:
- The direct impact of Gross National Income per capita and GDP on GNI.
- The role of inflation rates (consumer prices and GDP deflator) in explaining economic variations.
- The influence of gross capital formation, debt service, and foreign direct investment inflows on GNI.

The dataset included values for:
- **Dependent Variable**: Gross National Income (GNI)
- **Independent Variables**:
  - Gross National Income per capita
  - Current Gross Domestic Product
  - Annual GDP growth
  - GDP per capita (in USD)
  - Inflation (GDP deflator) for 2015 and 2010
  - Gross Capital Formation
  - Debt service as a percentage of GNI
  - Net foreign direct investment inflows
  - Net foreign direct investment
  - Inflation (consumer prices) for 2015 and 2010

### Key Insights

- Significant correlations were observed between GNI and certain variables such as GDP, GNI per capita, and gross capital formation.
- Inflation (both GDP deflator and consumer prices) displayed varying degrees of influence on GNI depending on the year and country.
- Foreign direct investment inflows had a measurable impact, highlighting the importance of international capital movement in national income.

### Tools and Techniques

- **Software Used**: STATA
- **Key Techniques**:
  - Regression Analysis
  - Data Visualization
  - Comparative Analysis of Economic Indicators

This study provides a comprehensive understanding of the factors influencing GNI and lays the groundwork for further econometric analysis in the field.
