The project is titled " Factors affecting Gross National Income(GNI)". We used a statistical package STATA for doing the analysis which helped in analyzing the intricate relationship between the factors and GNI. By the help of regression analysis we have analyzed how all these independent variables affect Gross National Income(GNI).
My main objective was to see if the factors such GDP, GNI per capita, inflation, foreign exchange and the other explanatory variable could explain the variations of Gross National Income across countries. In the given data I have taken all possible variables that both direct and indirect indicators which could have effect on Gross National Income.
Dependent Variable – Gross National Income (GNI)
Independent Variables – Gross National Income per capita
                                            Current Gross Domestic Product
                                             Annual GDP growth
                                            GDP per capita in USD
                                             Inflation (GDP deflator) 2015
                                             Inflation (GDP deflator) 2010
                                            Gross Capital Formation
                                            Debt service as a percentage of GNI
                                            Net foreign direct investment inflows
                                            Net foreign direct investment
                                            Inflation (consumer prices) 2015
                                            Inflation (consumer prices)2010
All of these variables are directly associated in explaining Gross National Income.
